# Raynian - A Social Pomodoro Application

Raynian is a social pomodoro application designed to enhance productivity and collaboration among users. The application follows the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that encourages users to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Additionally, Raynian adds a social element, allowing users to connect, share progress, and motivate each other.

## Features (Work in Progress)

The development of Raynian is still ongoing, and the application is continuously being improved with new features. Some of the planned features include:

- Pomodoro Timer: A built-in timer to help users manage work and break intervals effectively.
- Social Connectivity: Users can connect with friends, team members, or other users to share progress and encourage each other.
- Communication: Communicate with others through text, voice, video, and screen sharing.
- Leaderboards: A feature to showcase top performers and encourage healthy competition.
- Activity Feeds: Users can post updates about their progress, achievements, or thoughts during work sessions.
- Customizable Settings: Users can adjust the timer duration and break lengths and the look of their room to suit their preferences.
- Notifications: Reminders and notifications to keep users on track with their tasks and pomodoro sessions.
- Statistics and Analytics: Detailed insights into productivity patterns and time management.
